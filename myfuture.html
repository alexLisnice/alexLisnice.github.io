            <h2>High School</h2>
                <p>I hope to go to Lakewood High school because I like their ATM program there and I live very close there to. I also like their football and that is also my favorite sport so I would like to join that. If I go to Millikan then I would like to work in quest to help with my education but I have to get better grades to do that. If I were to join a sport at Millikan then I would also do football at Millikan to.
