            <h2>High School</h2>
                <p>I hope to go to Lakewood High school because I like their ATM program there and I live very close there to. I also like their football and that is also my favorite sport so I would like to join that. If I go to Millikan then I would like to work in quest to help with my education but I have to get better grades to do that. If I were to join a sport at Millikan then I would also do football at Millikan to.</p>

            <h2>College</h2>
                <p>The college I want to go to is LBUSD because my dad went there and there is good education there according to my dad. My dad was an electrical engineer when he went there to get his degree. I would like to be a mechanicanical engineer degree when I grow up so I can work more on mechanics like cars.</p>

            <h2>Career Interests</h2>
                <p>For my career I would be interested in becoming a mechanical engineer so I could open up my own shop for fixing bicycles or even cars. I wanted to do this because on my free time I like to work on bicycles in my backyard so they start working again. I am working on a bike right now and I am going to modify it to make it better than it was before and after I fixed it. A mechanical engineer seems fun because I can tinker with objects and make my own creations and it is fun to fix things to make them better.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>My goal is to get my first year for college for free but that means I have to do well in High School and get good grades to impress the college I want to go to. Another goal would to be able to go to a good high school with a good football team so I can enjoy my favorite sport in school. Learning how to ride motorcycles fluently when I get older would also be nice to do so I dont have to drive cars all the time.</p>
